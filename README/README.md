# Embedded System Design Course

This repository contains the course project for the Embedded Systems and Interface Technology course. It involves the development of communication protocols between a Windows PC and an STM32F047ZG development board using serial communication. The project focuses on implementing functionalities such as retrieving the STM32F407 chip hardware serial number and encrypting it with asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA or ECC to generate an authorization code.

## Project Structure

- `cpp_code/`: Contains C++ code for the Windows PC application.
- `c_code/`: Holds C code for the STM32F047ZG board program.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Project Requirements

The project involves:
- Establishing secure communication between Windows PC and STM32F047ZG.
- Implementing functionalities for hardware serial number retrieval and authorization code generation.
- Validating authorization codes on the STM32F047ZG board.
- Detailed documentation and project report submission.

## Getting Started
